# OpenSCAP promotional materials

This repo hosts logos, standard slide decks and other promotional materials related for OpenSCAP, SCAP Security Guide, SCAP Workbench, OpenSCAP Daemon and other projects related the OpenSCAP.

## Contributing rules and recommendations
1. only upload SVG or other source format files, **avoid PNG and other bitmap formats** if at all possible - we can render any of the SVGs into PNGs and SVGs work way better with versioning
2. usable with just open source tools. for example **don't upload Adobe Illustrator SVGs** that don't work in *Inkscape*
3. licensing - **permissive licensing preferred**, these files are supposed to go into other people's slides, on stickers, etc... **public domain recommended**
4. prefer **source formats** that can be rendered - e.g.: **upload Markdown, not HTML or PDF**
5. please follow the **naming convention**
